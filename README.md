# ImageInserter

A script for inserting images that exist in the archive into a database and
automatically generating thumbnails for them.

Note that this script runs on a relatively lower version of python3 so there are no
typehints. This is mostly a reminder to myself since I will keep trying to add them
every time I look at it.
